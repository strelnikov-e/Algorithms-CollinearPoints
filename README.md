# Algorithms-CollinearPoints
Collinear points finding algorithm

The problem. Given a set of n distinct points in the plane, find every (maximal) line segment that connects a subset of 4 or more of the points.

Project has two approaches to problem solution:
  - brute force
  - faster sorting based solution
